Hotel Booking Analysis


 In this Capstone Project on Exploratory Data Analysis we analyze, explore and get the           insights into given hotel bookings csv dataset from the timeline 2015-2017. The data set that we have contains booking information for a city hotel and a resort hotel. We used python coding, pandas libraries and data visualization libraries.

 Our approach to solving these problems were Loading the data from the drive into dataframe, cleaning the dataframe, Data Analysis using pandas library and Data Wrangling and Visualization  
We have divided the project into four main parts. Hotel Wise Analysis, Distribution Channel Wise Analysis, Cancellation related Analysis and Time and stay related Analysis.
 In Hotel wise analysis, we compared both the hotels focusing on revenue, number of bookings, waiting time, bookings cancellation and concluded which hotel has been better.
 In Distribution channel wise analysis, we have seen what distribution channel and market segment are being used by the customers to book the hotel.
 In Cancellation wise analysis, we see why the cancellation of bookings happen and concluded it has been mostly because of no car parking space.
 In time and stay related analysis, we analyzed what type of customers are mostly visiting and at what time of the year do they visit and which countries most of the customers are from.

 On the basis of EDA, we have identified why the customers mostly preferred City hotel over the resort hotel. The deals that are being provided by both the hotels and why booking cancellations happen. With the help of analysis we have concluded who the target customers are. Hotels can plan on improving the required parameters for more number of hotel bookings and to increase their demand.
